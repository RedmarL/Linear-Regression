    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "With a linear regression problem, the goal is to predict the value of a certain variable $y$. In contrast to classification algorithms (such as $k$-Nearest Neighbours from the previous exercise), $y$ has a continuous value.\n",
    "The output value $y$ will be modelled as a linear combination of the (transformed) input values $\\mathbf{x}$. We expect these input values to influence $y$ in some way, just like with classification. The extent to which the variables influence our output is determined by an unknown target function $f$. We try to estimate that target function by using linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any model, a linear regression model is a simplified version of reality. We may not have access to variables that do influence $f$. We may also include input variables in our model that have no effect on the real $f(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the odds of $f$ being an actual linear combination of (a transformation of) our input variables is very small. But often, a linear estimate is the best we can do."

The other elements of $\\mathbf{x}$ are distributed normally with expected value = 0 and variance = 1. (This is called a *standard normal distribution*.)\n",
